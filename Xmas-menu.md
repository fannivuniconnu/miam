Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 200ºC.

3. Peel and grate the ginger as well as 6 cloves of garlic. In a bowl, combine 2/3 of the ginger, the garlic, 1 tbsp of oil and the remaining half of the ground spices. Mix well. Cut the aubergine in big dices and make an incision in each dice, add some of the ginger mix into each aubergine piece and place the aubergine in a dish. Sprinkle the remaining ginger mix over the aubergine (if any is left) and bake for 30 min.
4. Grind the cardamom seeds, turmeric, dried chillies, cloves, fennel seeds (1 tbsp), cumin and black peppercorns together.
5. Chop the onions and the remaining 3 cloves of garlic.
6. Place a large pan over a medium heat and toast the ground spices for 1 min. Add 1 tbsp of oil, the onions, garlic and the remaining ginger. Cook for 10 min. 
7. Add the tomatoes, cinnamon stick and 200ml of water and let it simmer over a low heat for 30 min.
8. In a food processor, mix the cashews with 4 tbsp of water (you should get a paste with some cashew chunks). Add this to the curry and cook for another 5 min.
9. Chop the roasted cauliflower into florets and stir into the curry along with the aubergines.
10. Add the shaved coconut to the curry, as well as the pomegranate seeds. 


## Dessert


### Peanut and chocolate tart 

(original recipe from the Oh She Glows blog)

Ingredients:

* 75 ml + 60 ml melted coconut oil
* 80 ml + 3 tbsp + 75 ml maple syrup
* 2 tbsp + 85 g peanut butter
* 1 tbsp molasse
* salt
* 95 g salted roaster peanuts + some for garnish
* 150 g oats
* 1 can (400ml) of coconut milk
* 150 g of dark chocolate
* 3 tbsp olive oil
* 1/2 tbsp cinnamon
* 1/2 tbsp brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
  
Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven (180°C)
2. Prepare the crust: in a food processor, combine 95 g of peanuts, the oats and salt until it becomes a sandy texture. Add 60 ml of coconut oil, 3 tbsp of maple syrup and process until it comes together into a dough. Line a pie dish with parchment paper and crumble the dough over it. Starting from the center of the dish, press the dough together towards the edge with the back of a spoon (to avoid that the dough sticks to the spoon, dip the spoon into a cup of water once in a while). Pick the dough with a fork and bake for 15 min. Let the crust cool for 1h.
3. Prepare the sauce: in a food processor, combine 75 ml coconut oil, 125 ml maple syrup, 2 tbsp peanut butter, molasse and a pinch of salt and process until smooth. 
4. Make the filling: Add the coconut milk into a pot and turn the heat to medium. Add the chocolate and stir occasionally until melted. Add 75 ml of maple syrup, 85 g of peanut butter and a pinch of salt. Whisk until smooth and pour into the cooled crust. Place in the freezer for about 3-4h.
5. To serve, pour some of the sauce onto the tart (you may need to warm up the sauce if it became too solid) and sprinkle with some peanuts.
