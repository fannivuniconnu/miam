Instructions:

1. Prepare the lemon curd. Please note that this needs to be done a little bit in advance as the curd needs to cool down. Can be done the day before.
In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks and the sugar. In a saucepan, mix the water, the lemon juice and the corn starch and heat up on low heat while regularly stirring with a spoon so it doesn't burn or stick to the bottom of the pan. Once the mix is warm, take it of the stove and pour into the egg/sugar and mix well. Bring back to the stove and cook on low heat while stirring constantly. The curd will become thicker, when it does, remove from the stove again and add the butter. Mix well and let cool down. 
2. Prepare the crust. Preheat the oven (180Â°C). In a bowl, whisk together the flour, the sugars and the salt. Add the butter in small chunks. Mix well until you get a sandy texture. Add the egg yolk and mix until well combined. Roll the crust on a parchment paper and bring to a baking pan. Bake for 20 min with another sheet of parchment paper so the dough doesn't color too much. Remove the parchment paper from the top and bake for another 10min. Let cool down completely. 
3. Pour the lemon curd on the pie crust. Please make sure that both have cooled down completely for this step.
4. Prepare the French meringue. In a bowl, whip the egg whites with a pinch of salt until you have a very firm mousse. Continue whisking on lower speed and add the sugar slowly. The meringue is ready when you cannot feel any more sugar grains in the mousse. Spread onto the pie (you can use a piping bag or just spoon it on top). Turn the oven on lowest heat and let the meringue dry as long as needed (it can take 1h to 3h to dry completely, depending on the environment).
