### Tiramisu (vegan)

serves 6 people

Ingredients:
* 500 ml soy 
* 100 g + 1 tbsp sugar
* 1 tsp lemon juice
* 1 pack vanila sugar
* 1 pack vanilla pudding powder
* 2 pack modified starch ("Sahnesteif"), or 4 tbsp corn starch
* 200 g coconut oil
* 150 g rusks
* 450 ml cold coffee
* cocoa powder

Instructions:
1. Prepare 450 ml of coffee and set aside so it can cool down. 
2. Mix 200 ml soy milk with the sugars and the lemon juice. 
3. From the remaining soy milk, remove 5 tbsp and add them to a bowl. Add the vanilla pudding powder and 1 tbsp of sugar. Set aside.
4. Bring the remaining soy milk to a boil and add the vanilla pudding powder mix into it. Simmer for 1 min. 
5. Pour this into the soy milk mix from the beginning and whisk well.
6. Gradually add the coconut oil. You will get a smooth cream.
7. Dip the rusks in the coffee and place in a pan. Do one line of coffee-flavoured rusk and then add some cream. Repeat 2 to 3 times, depending on the size of your pan. Finish with a layer of cream and place in the fridge for at least 1h.
8. Dust some cocoa powder before serving.
