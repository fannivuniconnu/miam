### Lentils Briks (vegan)

for 16 pieces (4 people)

Ingredients:
* 8 sheets of [brik dough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brik) - if you cannot find brik dough, it should work with [filo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filo)
* 4 small potatoes
* 125 g red lentils
* 2 tbsp cashew butter
* 1 onion
* 1 bell pepper
* 1 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 garlic clove
* 2 tsp garam massala
* 2 tsp ground coriander
* 1 tsp turmeric
* 1 tbsp vegetal oil
* salt, black pepper, chili flakes to taste

Instructions:

1. Pre-heat the oven (180Â°C)
2. Peel and cut the potatoes in small dices. In a pot with boiling water, cook the red lentils and the potatoes for about 15-20min, or until the potatoes are tender.
3. Dice the bell pepper, the onion and garlic. You want to have small chunks of food so it's easier to fold the brik later.
4. Add the oil to a pan and saute the onion, garlic and bell pepper, along with all the spices, for about 5min.
5. Add the potatoes and lentils into the pan and mix well. Add the tomato paste and cashew butter and mix again. Season to taste.
6. Cut the sheets of brik though in halves. Take one half and fold the round side towards the large side so you have one long stripe of dough. Garnish and fold in triangles.
7. Place in a dish. Bake for 7 min, then turn around and bake for another 7 min.
